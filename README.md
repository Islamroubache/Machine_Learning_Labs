# Machine Learning Labs

This repository contains my solutions for all the laboratory exercises of the "Machine Learning" course at the Higher School of Computer Science (08 May 1945), Sidi Bel Abbes, Algeria, for 1st-year Master's students specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

## Overview
The labs cover practical applications of machine learning, including:

1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, categorical and continuous features.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, correlation analysis, and statistical summaries.

3. Regression Models: Simple & multiple linear regression, metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R²), and plotting actual vs predicted values.

4. Classification: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes (including a custom mixed-type implementation), Decision Trees, SVM, KNN, and ensemble methods.

5. Dimensionality Reduction: PCA, Kernel PCA, TruncatedSVD, NMF, and feature selection based on correlation.

6. Clustering: KMeans with evaluation metrics like Silhouette Score and Davies-Bouldin Score.

7. Machine Learning Pipelines: Use of scikit-learn Pipelines and ColumnTransformers for preprocessing and modeling.

8. Dataset Handling: Loading and preprocessing datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10), flattening images, sampling, and label encoding.

9. Visualization & Analysis: Interactive plots, learning curves, and decision tree visualization with Graphviz.

## Libraries Used

- Python: core language

- NumPy & Pandas: data handling

- scikit-learn: preprocessing, models, metrics

- Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly: visualization

- Graphviz: tree visualization

- Joblib: model saving/loading

## Notes

- All notebooks include detailed comments and explanations of preprocessing steps, model selection, and evaluation.

- Datasets like CIFAR-10 are loaded efficiently and prepared for training/testing with proper feature and label handling.

- The repository demonstrates end-to-end machine learning workflow: data preparation → modeling → evaluation → visualization.
